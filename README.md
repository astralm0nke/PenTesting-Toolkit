## Cybersecurity Toolkit ##

Basic tools for penetration testing/hacking written in python. For educational purposes only. See disclaimer.
+ Simple Portscanner built with vanilla python. Uses the modules sockets and IPy to create portscanner class that can then return banners/vulnerable ports to user.
+ Single thread/Threaded SSH-Bruteforcers. Use paramiko, socket, and threading libraries to bruteforce target SSH using list of common SSH passwords
+ ARP Spoofer. Uses scapy mainly to gather MAC addresses of target machine/network router. This is the basis of 'Man-in-the-Middle' attacks (don't do that)
  - Must be executed via terminal followed by router and target IPs
+ ðŸ‘ƒðŸ‘ƒPassword SnifferðŸ‘ƒðŸ‘ƒ
  - Used in conjunction with ARP Spoofer or a more sophisticated program like MITMf
+ Password Hash Cracker
  - MD5 and SHA1, but can be altered for preferred algo
+ Wireless Network Bruteforcer
+ KeyLogger
  - Functionality for key logging and grabbing target machine info
  - Data encryption/decryption engine and file cleanup
+ ðŸ“§Email ScraperðŸ“§
  - Scrapes emails from user input http address
+ WiFi Jammer
  - Sends dot11 deauth packets using scapy. This also works on encrypted networks because headers aren't encrypted-only payloads.
